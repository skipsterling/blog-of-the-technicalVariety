## Usage

Once logged in people using this applicaiton can create a blog, update it as needed and also delete it. They can also comment on other people's posts and they can comment on your posts. 

I have used the handlebars template to show the front end of the application. 

When you first arrive on the home page, It will be blank so you need to either click the sign up or log in options located in the navbar in the top right hand corner of the page.
